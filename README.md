## Future TODOs

- Improve current algorithms with more collected dataset points.
- Add more different types/kinds of algorithms.
- Add building ID and room ID identifiers, as well as the relative position to those rooms (inside or outside).
- Add user orientation and angle detection features (use accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer?).
- On top of classification features (actual building and floor identification, as well as distance and location coordinates estimation), add regression features (actual longitude and latitude estimation) without using GPS (since GPS tends to be less accurate for indoor context/settings/environments).
- Add choice of using BLE Bluetooth beacons for multilateration algorithm (some useful tools might include the [log-distance path loss model](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-distance_path_loss_model) or the [Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenbergâ€“Marquardt_algorithm)).
