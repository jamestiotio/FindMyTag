SUTD 50.003 ESC Indoor Tracking Project with [UnaBiz](https://www.unabiz.com/)

## Future TODOs

- Improve current algorithms with more collected dataset points.
- Add more different types/kinds of algorithms.
- Add building ID and room ID identifiers, as well as the relative position to those rooms (inside or outside).
- Add user orientation and angle detection features (use accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer?).
- On top of classification features (actual building and floor identification), add regression features (actual longitude and latitude estimation) without using GPS.
- Add choice of using BLE Bluetooth beacons for multilateration algorithm (some useful tools might include the [log-distance path loss model](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-distance_path_loss_model) or the [Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm)).
